Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Python3

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        
        fn = 0
        list_seen = {}
        
        for i in range(0, len(nums)):
            fn = nums[i]
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if fn + nums[j]== target:
                    return i, j
